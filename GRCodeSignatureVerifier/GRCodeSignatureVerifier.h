 @abstract The code requirements in text form (if codeRequirementsData is also set, It will be used instead)
 @discussion I recommend using at least the bundle identifier as a requirement:
 @example "identifier = com.mycompany.MyAppName"
 @warning If you want the signature verification to fail when resources are changed you MUST provide at least the identifier requirement, otherwise the verification will only fail when the app binary is changed
